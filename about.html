      I currently live in Santa Barbara, California. I am the Founder and CEO of Modern University - a coding school where students learn from professional engineers. I am also on the board of <a href="https://hac.bard.edu/">The Hannah Arendt at Bard College</a>.
    </p>
    <p>When I graduated college, I had no technical skill or technical network and $3K in the bank. I went on to found three startups including MaryElle (YC W21), convinced 3 co-founders to quit their jobs and join me with no money, sold 1 startup for $500K with no investment, taught myself to code, got my first engineering job at Amazon Alexa working on natural language understanding, won an Alexa hackathon, and my hackathon project launched publicly with <a href="https://twitter.com/katyperry/status/1299067512751972353?lang=en">Katy Perry answering her own questions</a>. I have since taught others to code who have landed jobs companies like Amazon.
</p>
    <p>My proudest moment was during high school. I organized a concert that earned $96,000 profit in four months on $2,000 of my own money. I donated it all to a family in need in my community.</p>
